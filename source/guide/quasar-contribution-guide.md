title: Quasar Framework Contributing Guide
---
The Quasar team is really excited when people help by contributing to Quasar Framework. It's what the FLOSS community is all about!

There are lots of features waiting for someone to write them and make the Quasar experience even better. Check [Github](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar) or contact [Razvan Stoenescu](https://github.com/rstoenescu) through [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/5TDhbDg)/email.

> Before submitting your contribution though, please make sure to take a moment and read through [the contributing guidelines](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and also [the code of conduct](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/blob/dev/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

You can also help with the documentation. If you catch a mistake or want to add a few lines to a page or write new pages, use the link at the end of each page of this website (specifically the *Suggest an edit on Github* link).
