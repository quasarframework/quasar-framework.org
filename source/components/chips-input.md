title: Chips Input
---
The Quasar Chips Input allows user to enter a group of text items, which is also editable in the form of quick deletion of the Chips in the list.

For more details on Chips used within Chips Input, please refer to its [documentation](/components/chip.html).

Works well with [QField](/components/field.html) for additional functionality such as a helper, error message placeholder and many others.

<input type="hidden" data-fullpage-demo="form/text-input/chips">

## Basic Usage

``` html
<q-chips v-model="model" />

<!-- Disabled -->
<q-chips v-model="model" disable />

<!-- With floating label -->
<q-chips v-model="model" float-label="Floating Label" />

<!-- With custom placeholder -->
<q-chips v-model="model" placeholder="Type some names" />

<!-- On error state -->
<q-chips v-model="model" error />
```

> The model variable must be an Array.

The user can remove a Chip by clicking/tapping on the `close` icon. Adding a Chip is done by clicking/tapping on the component, typing and then hitting the `send` icon or `<ENTER>` key. Pressing Backspace key either removes content of the textfield or if that is empty then the last Chip.

## Vue Properties
Supports `v-model` which should be binded to an Array of Strings in your scope.

| Vue Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `frame-color` | String | One from [Quasar Color Palette](/components/color-palette.html). See "Coloring" section. |
| `readonly` | Boolean | If readonly user can not add or remove chips. |

Common input field properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autofocus` | Boolean | Focus input field after rendering component. |
| `placeholder` | String | A text to be shown on textfield, mainly to explain what should be entered. |
| `name` | String | Adds a "name" attribute to the input field. |
| `max-length` | Number/String | Maximum characters allowed on input field. |
| `loading` | Boolean | Place the default spinner of the theme after textfield to highlight some process takes place in the background. |

Common input frame properties:

| Property | Type | Description |

| `prefix` | String | A text that should be shown before the textfield. |
| `suffix` | String | A text that should be shown after the textfield. |

| `disable` | Boolean | If set to `true`, textfield is disabled and the user cannot type anything. |
| `error` | Boolean | If set to true, the input fields colors are changed to show there is an error. |
| `before` | Array of Objects | Icon buttons on left side of input frame. Read below more details. |
| `after` | Array of Objects | Icon buttons on right side of input frame. Read below more details. |

### Icon buttons
This section refers to `before` and `after` properties which can add additional buttons as icons to the textfield. Here is the structure of the two properties:

```js
{
  // required icon
  icon: String,
  // required function to call when
  // icon is clicked/tapped
  handler: Function,

  // Optional. Show icon button
  // if model has a value
  content: Boolean,

  // Optional. Show icon button
  // if textfield is marked with error
  error: Boolean
}
```

Examples:
```html
<q-chips-input
  v-model="model"
  color="secondary"
  :after="[
    {
      icon: 'warning',
      error: true,
      handler () {
        // do something...
      }
    }
  ]"
/>
```

### Coloring
As you may have noticed above, there's a "color" and "frame-color" along "inverted" and "dark" properties.
By default, if you only use "color" then the input frame and Chips will share the color. If there's also a "frame-color" specified then the input frame color can differ from Chips' one.
When you want the frame inverted (color is applied to background), then specify "inverted" property.
When used on a dark background, specify "dark" property.

```html
<!-- Use a color. -->
<q-chips-input color="secondary" v-model="model" />

<!-- Use a color on inverted mode (background gets colored). -->
<q-chips-input color="secondary" v-model="model" />

<!--
  Using "frame-color" for the input frame,
  and "color" for the color of Chips.
-->
<q-chips-input color="dark" bg-color="amber" v-model="model" />

<!--
  Using "frame-color" for the input frame,
  and "color" for the color of Chips
  on inverted mode (frame-color is applied as background).
-->
<q-chips-input color="dark" bg-color="amber" v-model="model" />

<!--
  When we use the component on a dark background,
  so we specify "dark" property.
-->
<div class="bg-grey-9" style="padding: 15px">
  <q-chips-input dark color="amber" v-model="model" />
</div>
```

## Vue Methods
| Vue Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `add(value)` | Adds `value` to the model. |
| `remove(index)` | Removes value at `index` in model. |
| `focus()` | Focuses the input text field within Chips Input. |

## Vue Events
| Vue Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `@change(newVal)` | Triggered on model value change. |
