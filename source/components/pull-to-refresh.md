title: Pull Down to Refresh
---
When you want to allow the user to refresh the content or retrieve the newest content.

<input type="hidden" data-fullpage-demo="navigation/pull-to-refresh">

## Installation
Edit `/quasar.conf.js`:
```js
framework: {
  components: ['QPullToRefresh']
}
```

## Basic Usage
Use QPullToRefresh component as direct child of your page component, to encapsulate all its content. Refer to the source of the demo for a more detailed example.

``` html
<q-pull-to-refresh :handler="refresher">
  <!-- Content, whatever you like -->
  <p v-for="item in items">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
  </p>
</q-pull-to-refresh>
```

> **IMPORTANT**
> Do not wrap `<q-pull-to-refresh>` by a `<div class="layout-padding">`. If you must, place that `<div>` as direct child of `<q-pull-to-refresh>`.

  methods: {
    refresher (done) {
      // done - Function to call when you made all necessary updates.
      //        DO NOT forget to call it otherwise the refresh message
      //        will continue to be displayed

      // make some Ajax call then call done()
    }
  }
}
```
