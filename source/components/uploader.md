title: Uploader
---
Quasar supplies a way for you to upload files through QUploader component.

Works well with [QField](/components/field.html) for additional functionality such as a helper, error message placeholder and many others.

## Installation
Edit `/quasar.conf.js`:
```js
framework: {
  components: ['QUploader']
}
```

## Basic Usage
``` html
<q-uploader :url="url" />
```

## Vue Properties
| Vue Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `name` | String | Name of the file, if it should be different than the file's name. |
| `headers` | Object | Specify what headers need to be added to the XHR request |
| `url-factory` | Function | Function (with `file` object received as parameter) which returns a Promise that resolves to a URL. |
| `upload-factory` | Function | (v0.17+) Function defining a custom upload method which returns a Promise that resolves with a file. Check section below. |
| `no-content-type` | Boolean | (v0.17+) Avoid setting Content-Type header when uploading. |
| `with-credentials` | Boolean | (v0.17+) Sets `xhr.withCredentials` to `true` (doesn't apply when using `upload-factory`). |
| `method` | String | HTTP method to use (POST/PUT). Defaults to POST. |
| `filter` | Function | (v0.17+) Function defining a custom filter method which returns a list of filtered files. Check section below. |
| `extensions` | String | Extensions to allow for uploading. Example: `'.gif,.jpg,.jpeg,.png'` |
| `multiple` | Boolean | Allow multiple file uploads |
| `hide-upload-button` | Boolean | Hides the Upload button. You can then trigger it manually by calling `upload()` on the Vue ref |
| `hide-upload-progress` | Boolean | Hides the upload progress. Useful when you want some other means of signaling upload progress to the user. |

| `readonly` | Boolean | If set to `true`, Uploader is displayed as read-only. |
| `clearable` | Boolean | If set to `true`, the component offers the user an actionable icon to remove the current selection. |

### Upload Factory
Sometimes you need to define your own upload method. You can do this through `upload-factory` parameter, as below:

```html
<template>
  <q-uploader
    url=""
    :upload-factory="uploadFile"
  />
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    uploadFile (file, updateProgress) {
      // "file" is an Object containing file's props, including content

      // for updating progress (as 0-1 floating number), we need to call:
      // updateProgress (bytesTransferred / totalBytes)

      // we need to return a Promise
      // (resolves when upload is done, rejects when there's an error)
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

### Filter files
Sometimes you need to filter files before upload. You can do this through `filter` parameter.
Below an example with max file size check:

```html
<template>
  <q-uploader
    url=""
    :filter="filterFiles"
  />
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    filterFiles (files) {
      const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 3 * 1024 * 1024 /* =3M */
      // returns an Array containing allowed files
      return files.filter((file) => {
        return file.size <= MAX_FILE_SIZE
      })
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

### Icon buttons
This section refers to `before` and `after` properties which can add additional buttons as icons to the textfield. Here is the structure of the two properties:

```js
{
  // required icon
  icon: String,
  // required function to call when
  // icon is clicked/tapped
  handler: Function,

  // Optional. Show icon button
  // if model has a value
  content: Boolean,

  // Optional. Show icon button
  // if textfield is marked with error
  error: Boolean
}
```

Examples:
```html
<!--
  Show an icon button (with 'warning' as icon)
-->
<q-uploader
  :url="url"
  :after="[
    {
      icon: 'warning',
      handler () {
        // do something...
      }
    }
  ]"
/>
```

## Vue Methods
| Vue Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `upload()` | Start file(s) upload. |
| `pick()` | Trigger file pick (same as clicking the plus button on the uploader). Must be called as a direct consequence of user interaction (eg. in a click handler), due to browsers security policy. |
| `add(files)` | Add array of files. |
| `abort()` | Abort uploading file(s). |
| `reset()` | Reset uploader state. |

## Vue Events
| Vue Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `@add(files)` | Triggered when file is picked for upload |
| `@remove:abort(file)` | Triggered when file is removed from upload queue while uploading. |
| `@remove:cancel(file)` | Triggered when file is removed from upload queue before uploading. |
| `@remove:done(file)` | Triggered when file is removed from upload list after it has been  uploaded. |
| `@uploaded(file, xhr)` | Triggered individually for each file that has just been uploaded |
| `@fail(file, xhr)` | Triggered individually for each file that has encountered error while uploading |
| `@start` | Triggered when upload has started |
| `@finish` | Triggered when upload of file(s) has ended (with success or failure) |

## Examples

### AWS S3 - Uploading Using Pre-Signed URLs

```html
<!--
 x-amz-acl and content-type headers must match the ACL and ContentType
 specified when generating the signed url.
-->
<q-uploader
  url=""
  method="PUT"
  :headers="{ 'x-amz-acl': <acl>, 'content-type': <file-type> }"
  :url-factory="getSignedUrl"
  :send-raw="true"
/>
```

```js
async getSignedUrl (file) {
  const contentType = file.type // To send the correct Content-Type
  const fileName = file.name // If you want to use this value to calculate the S3 Key.
  const response = await api.getSignedUrl({ fileName, contentType }) // Your api call to a sever that calculates the signed url.
  return response.data.url
}
```
