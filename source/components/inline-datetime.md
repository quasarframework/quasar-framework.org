title: Inline Datetime
---
The Inline Datetime component provides a method to input dates and time or both and is shown directly on the page or element you are dislpaying. There are also two more versions available: [Datetime](/components/datetime.html), which also uses a modal/popup, as well as a [Datetime Range](/components/datetime-range.html).

You'll notice in the demos that the iOS and Material Datetime pickers look and act totally different, just like their native counterparts.

Works well with [QField](/components/field.html) for additional functionality such as a helper, error message placeholder and many others.

<input type="hidden" data-fullpage-demo="form/datetime/inline">
