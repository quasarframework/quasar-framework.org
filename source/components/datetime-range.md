title: Datetime Range
---

The Datetime Range component offers the users the ability to input a date, time or datetime interval. It is based off of the [Datetime component](/components/datetime.html). Before diving in, make sure you know how to use the Datetime component, since this component shares same properties.

In essense, Datetime Range is made up of two Datetime components, one for "from" and one for "to", making up a date interval together.
