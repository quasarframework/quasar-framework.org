title: Integrating Layout with Router
---
You can benefit from Vue Router's capabilities while structuring your routes with a Quasar Layout. The information below is just a recommendation and not a mandatory folder/files structure to follow. Quasar allows you full freedom. Take the lines below only as an example.

[Layout](/components/layout.html) is the component used to encapsulate pages, so that multiple pages will share the same header, left / right side and so on. In order to understand how this works, you need a little bit of reading on [Vue Router nested routes](http://router.vuejs.org/en/essentials/nested-routes.html).

## Example
To make it more clear, let's take an example. We have one layout ('user-layout') and two pages ('user-feed' and 'user-profile'). We want to configure the website/app routes like this: `/user/feed` and `/user/profile`.

Our router configuration (usually in `/src/router.js`) will look like this:
```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueRouter from 'vue-router'

Vue.use(VueRouter)

/*
  Avoid lazy loading while in dev mode
  to benefit from HMR
 */
function load (component) {
  return () => System.import(`components/${component}.vue`)
}

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/user',

    // We point it to our component
    // where we defined our QLayout
    component: load('user/layout'),

    // Now we define the sub-routes.
    // These are getting injected into
    // layout (from above) automatically
    // by using <router-view> placeholder
    // (need to specify it in layout)
    children: [
      {
        path: 'feed',
        component: load('user/feed')
      },
      {
        path: 'profile',
        component: load('user/profile')
      }
    ]
  }
]

export default new VueRoute({
  ...,
  routes // our routes
})
```

The above routes look for a folder called 'user' in '/src/components'. Feel free to tweak `load()` function to your liking. The file structure needed for vue components of your app for the configuration above is:
```bash
src/
└── components/
    └── user
        ├── layout.vue   # our vue component where we use QLayout
        ├── feed.vue     # our user feed page
        └── profile.vue  # our user profile page
```

Pages get injected into QLayout where `<router-view>` component is specified, replacing it. Remember to always use this Vue component whenever your Layout has pages attached to it.

```html
<q-layout>
  ...
  <!--
    This is where your pages will get
    injected into your Layout
  -->
  <router-view />
  ...
</q-layout>
```
