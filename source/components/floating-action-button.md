title: Floating Action Buttons
---
A Quasar Floating Action Button (FAB) represents the primary action in an App Page. But it's not limited to only that. It can contain sub-actions too, and more importantly it can also be used inline into your Pages or Layouts.

<input type="hidden" data-fullpage-demo="web-components/fab">

## Getting Started

So there are two types: expandable (has sub-actions) and non-expandable. **If not expandable, a simple circular button will suffice**. Otherwise check the HTML tags below.

``` html
<!-- Non-expandable -->
<button class="primary circular" @click="method()">
  Button label
</button>

<!-- Expandable -->
<q-fab
  classNames="purple"
  icon="keyboard_arrow_up"
  direction="up"
>
  <q-small-fab
    class="white"
    @click.native="someMethod()"
    icon="mail"
  ></q-small-fab>

  <q-small-fab
    class="white"
    @click.native="someMethod()"
    icon="alarm"
  ></q-small-fab>
</q-fab>
```

We'll continue describing only the expandable ones, as the non-expandable are simple circular buttons and you can read about them in the Buttons documentation page.
