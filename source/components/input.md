title: Input (Textfield)
---
Quasar's Input component is the basis for text (we'll call it "Singe Line Input") and textarea (we'll call it "Multiple Line Input") form input. It can be used for regular text input, passwords, email addresses, numbers, telephone numbers, urls and auto-growing text areas.

Works well with [QField](/components/field.html) for additional functionality such as a helper, error message placeholder and many others.

<input type="hidden" data-fullpage-demo="form/text-input/textbox">

## Basic Usage
``` html
<!-- Single Line Input -->
<q-input v-model="text" />
<q-input v-model="text" stack-label="Stack Label" />
<q-input v-model="text" float-label="Float Label" placeholder="Gigi" />

<!-- Multiple Line Input -->
<q-input
  v-model="area"
  type="textarea"
  float-label="Textarea"
  :max-height="100"
  :min-rows="7"
/>
```

## Vue Properties
Supports `v-model` which should be binded to a String or Number (depending on `type` property used) in your scope.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | String |  Must be one of the following: `text` (default), `textarea`, `email`, `tel`, `file`, `number`, `password` and `url`. This is important as it determines the keyboard type popping up on mobile devices. |
| `clearable` | Boolean | If set to `true`, the component offers the user an actionable icon to remove the entered text. |

When you set type to "number", there are some additional properties that you can use:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `min` | Number | Minimum number that the user can type. |
| `max` | Number | Maximum number that the user can type. |
| `step` | Number | Default is `1`. If Up or Down keys are used, this tells the increment amount. |
| `max-decimals` | Number | Maximum number of decimals that should be displayed. |

When you set type to "textarea", these are additional properties that you can use:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `min-rows` | Number | Minimum number of rows to display regardless of how many rows the content spans to. |
| `max-height` | Number | Number in pixels that determines the maximum height of textarea which auto-grows. |

Common input field properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autofocus` | Boolean | Focus input field after rendering component. |
| `placeholder` | String | A text to be shown on textfield, mainly to explain what should be entered. |
| `name` | String | Adds a "name" attribute to the input field. |
| `max-length` | Number/String | Maximum characters allowed on input field. |
| `loading` | Boolean | Place the default spinner of the theme after textfield to highlight some process takes place in the background. |

Common input frame properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prefix` | String | A text that should be shown before the textfield. |
| `suffix` | String | A text that should be shown after the textfield. |
| `float-label` | String | A text label that will "float" up above the input field, once the input field gets focus. |
| `stack-label` | String | A text label that will be shown above the input field and is static. |
| `color` | String | One from [Quasar Color Palette](/components/color-palette.html). |
| `inverted` | Boolean | Inverted mode. Color is applied to background instead. |
| `dark` | Boolean | Is QInput rendered on a dark background? |
| `align` | String | One of 'left', 'center' or 'right' which determines the text align within textfield. |
| `disable` | Boolean | If set to `true`, textfield is disabled and the user cannot type anything. |
| `error` | Boolean | If set to true, the input fields colors are changed to show there is an error. |
| `before` | Array of Objects | Icon buttons on left side of textfield. Read below more details. |
| `after` | Array of Objects | Icon buttons on right side of textfield. Read below more details. |

### Icon buttons
This section refers to `before` and `after` properties which can add additional buttons as icons to the textfield. Here is the structure of the two properties:

```js
{
  // required icon
  icon: String,
  // required function to call when
  // icon is clicked/tapped
  handler: Function,

  // Optional. Show icon button
  // if model has a value
  content: Boolean,

  // Optional. Show icon button
  // if textfield is marked with error
  error: Boolean
}
```

Examples:
```html
<!--
  Show an icon button (with 'warning' as icon)
  when there is an error on QInput (through "error" prop)
-->
<q-input
  v-model="text"
  :error="error"
  type="password"
  :after="[
    {
      icon: 'warning',
      error: true,
      handler () {
        // do something...
      }
    }
  ]"
/>

<!--
  Show an icon button (with 'arrow_forward' as icon)
  when the model has a non empty value
-->
<q-input
  v-model="text"
  :after="[
    {
      icon: 'arrow_forward',
      content: true,
      handler () {
        // do something...
      }
    }
  ]"
/>
```

### Labeling
QInput comes with two built-in labeling possibilities. You can use the `float-label` or the `stack-label` properties to add text for the labeling of the field. A `stack-label` is static in its position above the field, whereas the `fload-label` is more dynamic. Check the examples to the right to see the difference.

```html
<q-input v-model="text" stack-label="Stack Label" placeholder="Add some text..."  />
<q-input v-model="text" float-label="Float Label"/>
```
As shown above, you can also add a placeholder to help explain to the user what type of input should be entered.

### Password Input
If you use the input type `password`, the component will hide the characters entered by the user, but it will also offer the user a clickable icon to toggle the input, to make the input legible.

``` html
<q-input v-model="text" type="password" float-label="Password" />
```

### Number Input
The below example shows a number input type.
``` html
<q-input v-model="number" type="number" float-label="Number" />
```

### Prefixes and Suffixes
You can add a text before or after the field as part of an input mask, for instance, for showing Euro or US Dollar currency.

``` html
<!-- Notice prefix property -->
<q-input v-model="number" type="number" prefix="$US" stack-label="Number" />

<!-- Notice suffix property -->
<q-input v-model="number" type="number" suffix="€" stack-label="Number" />

<!-- Notice suffix property -->
<q-input v-model="email" type="email" suffix="@gmail.com" stack-label="Type Google Email" />
```

### Error State
You can control the color to show a mistake in user input or some other systematic error. To do this set the `error` prop to true.

``` html
<q-input :error="error" v-model="text" float-label="Colored Black" color="black" />
```

If you'd like to show the user an explanatory text about the error condition, you can wrap the QInput in a QField component.

``` html
<!--
  Notice error prop is now used on wrapper QField
  instead of on QInput now
-->
<q-field :error="error" error-label="Oh buggers! You made a boo boo.">
  <q-input v-model="text" float-label="Colored with Error" color="amber"  />
</q-field>
```

Please refer to the [QField documentation](/components/field.html) for more info about its usage.

### Loading State
If, for some reason, the input requires some longer term background action or process, you can add a spinner to indicate progress by setting the `loading` prop to `true`.

``` html
<q-input :loading="loading" v-model="text" placeholder="Add some text..." />
```

## Vue Methods
| Vue Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `clear()` | Clear the model. Sets it to empty String `''`. |
| `togglePass()` | Applies to type "password" only. Toggles between showing legible password or not. |
| `focus()` | Focused the textfield. |
| `blur()` | Makes textfield lose focus. |

## Vue Events
| Vue Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `@change(newVal)` | Triggered on model value change. |
| `@focus` | Triggered on focus. |
| `@blur` | Triggered a blur. |
| `@keydown` | Triggered by keydown event on textfield. |
| `@keyup` | Triggered by keyup event on textfield. |
| `@click` | Triggered by a native `click` event on textfield. |

## Formatting
It is possible to add formatting to a QInput in two ways. One is for the basic component. The other is with the QField component. Both methods offer "inverted" coloring.

### Additional Vue Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `color` | String | The color the QInput should have. The default is `primary`. |
| `inverted`| Boolean | Set to `true`, to color field's background set by the `color` prop. |
| `dark` | Boolean | Set to true, if the field is on a dark background. It will invert the text color to make it light. |
| `align` | Text | Controls the 'right', 'center' or 'left' alignment of the input. The default is 'left'. |

### Basic Formatting Examples
This will color the field black.

```html
<q-input v-model="text" float-label="Colored" color="black" />
```

This will show an inverted colored input field in amber. Here, the text is automatically inverted to a lighter color.

```html
<q-input v-model="text" inverted color="amber" stack-label="Amber Colored Background" />
```

### Alignment
You can also align the input to the right, center or left. The default is left. The below example will show a field for Euro currency input.

```html
<!-- Align textfield content to the right -->
<q-input v-model="number" align="right" type="number" suffix="€" stack-label="Number" />  
```

### Basic Usage with QField
It is also possible to further enhance a QInput by wrapping it in a [QField](/components/field.html) component.

``` html
<div class="bg-grey-9" style="width: 500px; padding: 25px">
  <q-field
    icon="wifi"
    label="Some Label"
    :count="10"
    helper="Some helper"
    :error="error"
    error-label="Some error"
  >
    <q-input
      v-model="text"
      dark
      color="yellow"
      float-label="Textfield"
    />
  </q-field>
</div>
```

The above usage of QField will show the input field within a dark grey background with an inverse white text. Notice the usage of the `dark` prop for QInput. This controls the inversion of the text color.

Please refer to the [QField documentation](/components/field.html) for more info about its usage.

## Validations with Vuelidate
Quasar's recommendation for doing form components validations is  [Vuelidate](https://monterail.github.io/vuelidate/) as it fits great with the overall architecture. It's simple, lightweight and **model-based**.

```html
<template>
  <q-input
    type="email"
    :error="$v.email.$error"
    v-model="email"
    @blur="$v.email.$touch"
  />
</template>

<script>
import { required, email } from 'vuelidate/lib/validators'

export default {
  data () {
    return {
      email: ''
    }
  },
  validations: {
    email: { required, email }
  }
}
</script>
```

For more options like displaying an error label, a helper or character counter, wrap QInput with a QField. [Here](/components/field.html#Validations-with-Vuelidate) is a more involved example.

## Directive Modifiers for `v-model`

Vue comes with standard modifiers on `v-model`, which can be useful in conjunction with QInput. They are `.lazy` and `.trim`.

### `.lazy`

By default, `v-model` syncs the input with the data after each `input` event. You can add the `lazy` modifier to instead sync after `change` events:

``` html
<!-- synced after "change" instead of "input" -->
<q-input v-model.lazy="msg">
```

### `.trim`

If you want the user's input to be trimmed automatically, you can add the `trim` modifier to your `v-model` managed inputs:

```html
<q-input v-model.trim="msg">
```
