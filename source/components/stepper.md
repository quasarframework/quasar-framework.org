title: Quasar Stepper
---
A Stepper is an interface for users to show numbered steps or for navigation. It's usually useful when the user has to follow steps to complete a process, like in a wizzard.

<input type="hidden" data-fullpage-demo="web-components/stepper">

The navigation is handled by Quasar. The user is able to go forward, back and to finish the process.

## Basic Usage

``` html
<q-stepper @finish="finish()" ref="stepper">
  <q-step title="Select campaign settings">
    Content, DOM Elements, Components, ...
  </q-step>

  <!-- Step specifying when user should be able to jump to next step -->
  <q-step title="Create an ad group" :ready="ready">
    Content, DOM Elements, Components, ...
    Do something and change 'ready' variable to boolean 'true'.
  </q-step>

  <q-step title="Create an ad">
    Content, DOM Elements, Components, ...
  </q-step>
</q-stepper>
```

## Stepper Container Component
> Following Vue methods and events apply only to `<q-stepper>` container component.

| `previousStep()` | Stepper goes to previous step. |
| `finish()` | Stepper goes to "complete" state. |

## Step Vue Properties & Methods
> Following Vue properties and methods apply only to `<q-step>` child component.

### Vue Properties
| Vue Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | String | Step title |
| `ready` | Boolean | Can user continue with next step? Default is `true`. |
| `beforeNext(next)` | Function | Function to call before jumping to next step. |

> `beforeNext(next)` allows you to take some action (like validating some fields) and decide if Stepper can go to the next step (in which case `next()` must be called) or not.

### Vue Methods
| Vue Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `nextStep()` | Stepper goes to next step. |
| `previousStep()` | Stepper goes to previous step. |
| `finish()` | Stepper goes to "complete" state. |

## Handling Jump to Next Step
There are two options (or you can even combine them).

### Boolean Vue Property
Specify the `ready` Vue property (Boolean) makes Stepper activate or deactivate the `Next` or `Finish` button. See step #2 in the demo.

``` html
<q-step title="Create an ad group" :ready="ready">
  Content, DOM Elements, Components, ...
  Do something and change 'ready' variable to boolean 'true'.
</q-step>
```

### Function Vue Property
Specify `beforeNext` Vue property by assigning it to a Function. This function is called and it's up to you the developer to decide if Stepper should go to the next step or not.

``` html
<q-step title="Create an ad group" :beforeNext="beforeNext">...</q-step>
```
``` js
beforeNext (next) {
  // do something here (async supported)... then

  if (/* we can jump to next step*/) {
    next()
  }
  // otherwise just don't call next()
}
```

## Handling Stepper Finish
Use `@finish` event on `<q-stepper>` to execute a method when user hits the `Finish` button.
``` html
<q-stepper @finish="doSomething()">
  ...
</q-stepper>
```

## Coloring
Use one of the Quasar colors from the Color Palette, like `primary`, `secondary`, `orange`, `teal` as CSS class:

``` html
<q-stepper class="orange">...</q-stepper>
```
