---

The observable components allow you to add event triggering components to your own components. 

The are are three different observable components:

 `q-resize-observable` - emits an `@resize` event, when the component's size changes. 
 `q-scroll-observable` - emits an `@scroll` event, when the user scrolls.
 `q-window-resize-observable` - emits an `@resize` event, when the screen size changes.
